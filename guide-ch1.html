              When the person in front of you
              <br>
              reaches the <b>last footstep</b>,

              1. Move along with audio OR go straight to 11th footstep.
              <br>
              2. When you hear <i>"eleven"</i>, press the button on the wall to your right.

                <i>One</i> (take a step)
                <br>
                I'm ten years old. Which means I'm fully capable of walking home alone from my best friend's house.
                <br>
                <i>Two, three, four</i>
                <br>
                But I must admit. When it's dark out, I get a little scared and wish I had someone with me. Especially… when crossing the field… at night.
                <br>
                <i>Five, six, seven.</i>
                <br>
                The pond should be close now. It's the only thing between me and my exit. I can't see well when it's dark, so I need to count my steps correctly.
                <br>
                <i>Eight</i>
                <br>
                To calm myself down, I think about the fishies that rest in the water. The pond seems quiet and peaceful at night; it must be so cool to sleep in a leaf hammock under the stars.
                <br>
                <i>Nine, ten</i>
                <br>
                Sometimes, when I'm too deep in my imagination, I lose count.
                <br>
                <i>Eleven.</i>
                <br>
                Ah! Ten steps. Ten steps. It takes ten steps to get to the edge of the pond.
                Must tread around the pond lightly now. My house is just up ahead after this last stretch of field. Ten more steps. Same as how I entered.
                The lights are off. Phew. That means it's quiet.
